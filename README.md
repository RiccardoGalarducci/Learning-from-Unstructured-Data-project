# Audio Data Classification

This repository contains the Learning from Unstructured Data project developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

The aim of the project is to use the deep neural networks to solve a multi-class classification problem of audio data (wav file). The implementation of the networks is done in Tensorflow/Keras.

Three types of deep models are used to solve the task:

- 1D Convolution Network and/or 2D Convolution Network
- Recurrent Network
- Transformer Network

Each model is trained and evaluated on raw input data (wav files) and the result of applying the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the project and the jupyter notebook where the models are implemented.
