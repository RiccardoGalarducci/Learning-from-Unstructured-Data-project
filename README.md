# Learning from Unstructured Data | Project

This repository contains the Learning from Unstructured Data project developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

The objective is to use the Deep Learning models (neural networks) mentioned below to, given a wav file, identify its class. The implementation of the networks is done in Tensorflow/Keras. 

- 1D Convolution Network and/or 2D Convolution Network
- Recurrent Network
- Transformer Network

Each model is trained and evaluated on raw input data (wav files) and the result of applying the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the project and the jupyter notebook where the models are implemented.
