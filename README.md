# Audio Data Classification

This repository contains the **Learning from Unstructured Data project** developed during the Erasmus program at Nova FCT in Lisbon in Big Data Analytics and Engineering.

## Description

The aim of the project is to use different types of deep neural networks to solve a multi-class classification problem on audio data (wav file). The implementation of the networks are done using in Tensorflow/Keras.

Three types of deep models are employed to solve the task:

- 1D Convolution Network and 2D Convolution Network
- Recurrent Network
- Transformer Network

Each model is trained and evaluated on both raw data (wav files) and on the Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT).

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf report of the project and the jupyter notebook where the models are implemented.
